- 👋 Hi, I’m Grzegorz! I have had decided that I need some changes in my life so I've started learning to code. Now I have few months of non-commertial expirience and pretty good set of skills. I'm native in Polish, fluent in English and average in Russian. I'm heavily interested in Machine Learning algorythms
- 👀 In my free time I’m invested in sports, mostly chess and football, but I have wide span of topics I know something interesting about. I'm definitely a raconteurish type of person
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate Python, and working on broadening my overall programming knowledge
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on entry level projects. I`m looking forward to gain expirience. Quick learning was never a problem for me
- 📫 How to reach me? You can contact me by email grzegorzmanturo@gmail.com
